# FL# (FRIENDS-LANGUAGE-SHARP)

## Description

FL# (FRIENDS-LANGUAGE-SHARP) is a programming language created for friends. This language was developed as a group project to enable our team to collaborate and enhance our programming skills.

## Objective

1. **Create a programming language for friends.**
   - **Unique Feature:** An additional variable type called `operator`.
   - **Structure:** Functions, queues, variables, exception handling.
   - **Types:** Several types implemented (e.g., int, string).
   - **File reading/writing.**

## Key Language Features

- **Unique Feature:** An additional variable type `operator`, allowing an operator to be assigned to a variable.
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    operator a = |*|;
    5 a 6 = 30
    operator b = |+|;
    5 b 5 = 10
    ```

- **Supported Data Types:**
  - `string`
  - `int`
  - `boolean`
  - `double`

- **Supported Structures:**
  - `queue`

- **Language Features:**
  - Exception handling

- **Supported Constructs:**
  - `if()`
  - `for()`
  - `while()`

- **File reading and writing.**

## Development Tools

- **Java:** This language provides a lot of sample code, making it easy to "build upon" and create our own solutions.
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** The environment we are familiar with, ensuring a convenient and straightforward development experience.
